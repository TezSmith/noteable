Random Access Memory aka "Working Memory" or "Memory"
-> code variables are stored here
-> Do not confuse with Storage (which is where files, programs & apps are kept)
   Storage is also referred to as Persistent Storage or Disc

RAM has billions of shelves that are denoted by it's Memory Address
-> A shelf holds 8 bits. A bit is a tiny electrical switch that can be turned
  on (corresponds with 1) or off (corresponds with 0).
-> 8 bits = 1 Byte.
Recap: A shelf of RAM has 8 bits or 1 Byte.

The shelves of RAM are connected to a Memory Controller with is connected to a Processor.
-> The memory controller does the actual reading and writing of RAM, through a direct connection.
-> The direct connection gives us access to any address at any time, hence the name RAM.

"Even though the memory controller can jump between far-apart memory addresses quickly,
programs tend to access memory that's nearby. So computers are tuned to get an extra speed boost
when reading memory addresses that are close to each other."

The Processor has a series of caches where it reads a copy of things recently read from the RAM.
-> The cache is much faster to read from that the RAM itself.
-> When asking for information from a memory address, the Memory Controller also sends back
  content from other nearby addresses and the Processor puts that stuff in it's cache.

Ex. "If the processor asks for the contents of address 951, then 952, then 953, then 954...
    it'll go out to RAM once for that first read, and the subsequent reads will come straight
    from the super-fast cache."

Ex. "But if the processor asks to read address 951, then address 362, then address 419...then
    the cache won't help, and it'll have to go all the way out to RAM for each read."
